# Multi-URL Example Configuration
# 
# This example shows how to configure multiple URLs for batch processing.
# Simply copy URLs from this file to your .env TARGET_URLS variable.

# Example with 3 Zenodo URLs (replace with your actual URLs):
# TARGET_URLS=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17148962,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12345678,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.98765432

# You can format it on multiple lines for readability (remove line breaks when adding to .env):
# TARGET_URLS=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17148962,\
#             https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12345678,\
#             https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.98765432

# Tips:
# - Separate URLs with commas (no spaces recommended)
# - The script will process them in order
# - Each URL will be opened, Preview clicked, Download clicked
# - Progress and summary statistics will be displayed
# - Failed URLs won't stop the processing of remaining URLs
